# Steering-behaviors-for-boids
Currently built with cmake/make for windows. To run the simulation navigate to build folder with cmd, and run src\main.exe
(Note main must be run with the build folder as root).

# Disclaimer
While the contents of src/core/ is something completed primarily by myself, other portions have been completed in collaboration with others/includes only little work by me.
