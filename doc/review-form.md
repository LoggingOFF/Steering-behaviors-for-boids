Name of project to be reviewed: Steering Behaviours

Names of reviewers: Sakari Ropponen, Joona Sauramäki, Sampo Vänninen

Provide short comments (2-4 sentences) for each item below.

## 1. Overall design and functionality (0-6p)

  * 1.1: The implementation corresponds to the selected topic and
scope. The extent of project is large enough to accommodate work for
everyone (2p)

The implementation corresponds to the selected topic, but the scope is difficult to assess as of now and may be too small for such a large group. (1p)

  * 1.2: The software structure is appropriate, clear and well
documented. e.g. class structure is justified, inheritance used where
appropriate, information hiding is implemented as appropriate. (2p)

-

  * 1.3: Use of external libraries is justified and well documented. (2p)

Agreed. (2p)

## 2. Working practices (0-6p)

  * 2.1: Git is used appropriately (e.g., commits are logical and
frequent enough, commit logs are descriptive). (2 p)

Git is used frequently, but the commits logs are rather vague. (1p)

  * 2.2: Work is distributed and organised well. Everyone contributes to
the project and has a relevant role that matches his/her skills. The
distribution of roles is described well enough. (2p)

Thus far according to git commits, work is being done primarily by two individuals. The work division seems sensible, however. (1p)


  * 2.3: Quality assurance is appropriate. Implementation is tested
comprehensively and those testing principles are well documented. (2p)

-


  * 3.1: Building the software is easy and well documented. CMake or
such tool is highly recommended. (2p)

As of now this is not true. The makefile is working with linux.

  * 3.2: Memory management is robust, well-organised and
coherent. E.g., smart pointers are used where appropriate or RO3/5 is
followed. The memory management practices should be documented. (2p)

-

  * 3.3: C++ standard library is used where appropriate. For example,
containers are used instead of own solutions where it makes sense. (2
p)

The library seems to be used where required. The final implementation will likely follow suit. (2p)


  * 3.4: Implementation works robustly also in exceptional
situations. E.g., functions can survive invalid inputs and exception
handling is used where appropriate. (2p)

-

## 4. Project extensiveness (0-10p)

  * Project contains features beyond the minimal requirements: Most of
the projects list additional features which can be implemented for
more points. Teams can also suggest their own custom features, though
they have to be in the scope of the project and approved by the course
assistant who is overseeing the project. (0-10p)

Project is not complete yet, but according to planned features the requirements are met, along with some additions. (7p)
